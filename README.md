# opensearch-lab-code

This code can be use to deploy an Opensearch cluster with Podman-Compose on Oracle Linux 8.

The `main` branch has the final version of the `compose.yaml` file. There are two branches that are used in the hands-on lab:

* `activity-01` - Podman setup and testing
* `activity-02` - Podman-Compose setup and build
